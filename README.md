# An Intro to Progressive Web Apps

Progressive Web Apps are one of the new technologies that enable a native app experience within a web application. Over the past year they have become widely supported across browsers and devices. With companies such as Google and Uber adopting this approach to deliver their services, their momentum is ever increasing.

Progressive Web Apps are installable and live on the user's home screen as a native app without the need for an app store. They offer an immersive full screen experience without the need of writing a native application. They offer functionality to allow working offline, push notifications and background workers bringing them ever closer to the capabilities of native applications. And the best part, typically they can be enabled in your existing web application with just a few tweaks.

With them becoming a more mainstream utility in our toolbelt, this talk will focus on:

* What they are?
* What can they provide?
* Their benefits and limitations over native apps
* When you might use them?
* How they work? With a walk through the basics of creating one.
* Where they may fit in the future and alternatives?


This project is a sample to demonstrate the functionality a PWA can provide.

Here is the presentation to go along with this repository.
